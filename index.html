<p> 
Housing prices in California has been varying vastly over the past few years but was this the case before technological boom? With the help of this plot we are trying to understand how housing prices in popular counties across California have changed over the years. We can see that most of the housing prices have started increasing rapidly from January 1997 to June 2007. After that there has been a sharp decrease in housing prices till April 2009 and haven't stabalised until early quarter of 2013. This huge change can be attributed to the <i>Great Recession</i> observed in 2009. After 2013, housing prices have reclaimed their previous glory and are at an all time high in San Francisco Bay Area. Even though other counties such as <b>Los Angeles Metropolitan Area</b>, <b>San Diego</b>, <b>Sacramento</b> and <b>Fresno</b> have recovered from the <b>Great Recession</b>, they have not been able to reclaim their previous glory.
