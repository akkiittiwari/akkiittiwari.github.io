Housing prices in California has been varying vastly over the past few years but was this the case before technological boom? With the help of this plot we are trying to understand how housing prices in popular counties across California have changed over the years. We can see that most of the housing prices have started increasing rapidly from January 1997 to June 2007. After that there has been a sharp decrease in housing prices till April 2009 and haven't stabalised until early quarter of 2013. This huge change can be attributed to the <i>Great Recession</i> observed in 2009. After 2013, housing prices have reclaimed their previous glory and are at an all time high in San Francisco Bay Area. Even though other counties such as <b>Los Angeles Metropolitan Area</b>, <b>San Diego</b>, <b>Sacramento</b> and <b>Fresno</b> have recovered from the <b>Great Recession</b>, they have not been able to reclaim their previous glory.

<p>Now that we have seen how the housing prices vary accross the years for different counties, let's also have a look how the population and other factors changed in these counties during the same time period.</p>

<p>  How the housing prices in various counties across California correlate with population and unemployment rate? </p>
<br>
<p> It’s reasonable to assume that counties with larger population and lower unemployment rate tend to have higher housing prices. Even though this is the reality overall, these factors vary widely across different counties. For example, let’s consider San Francisco, one of the most costliest cities to live in USA. It’s housing prices are highly correlated with population and have an insignificant correlation with unemployment. This strong correlation is not observed in other Metropolitan cities like ‘Los Angeles’ . In case of remote counties like Nevada, we do not find any correlation at all. 3 different counties in a single state have not only highly varying housing prices but are also correlated with population differently. We can clearly see that housing prices in California do not behave similarly across all counties. </p>
